# Text-Summarizer
Open source Java based Text Summarizing Algorithm

This text summarizer is used in my Android app called "SumIt! Text Summarizer". 
I am continiously trying to improve the results I get from this algorithm/implementation. This is my own implementation.
It is meant to support not just large pieces of text pasted/passed in, but also text from online URLs (that means removing and formatting text correctly).
Back when I first made this it really only supported just text. But now I am opening it up for those interested in taking a look.
And for those who want to modify it or improve it.
